description: Debug or fix failing GitHub PR checks that run in GitHub Actions. Use when the user asks to inspect failing checks, Actions logs, or CI root cause on a pull request. Prefer GitHub MCP Actions tools when they are connected; otherwise use `gh` and the bundled inspect script before implementing any approved fix.

# GitHub Actions CI Fix

## When to use

- Failing GitHub Actions checks on a pull request
- The user asks to debug CI, inspect Actions logs, or fix a red check

## Instructions

This workflow is hybrid:

- Use GitHub MCP tools from this plugin for PR metadata, changed files, and review context.
- Prefer MCP Actions tools (workflow runs, jobs, logs) when the client actually exposes them.
- Fall back to `gh` and `scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py` when Actions tools are missing, because the default remote MCP toolset may not include Actions.
- Summarize the root cause first, propose a focused fix plan, and implement only after explicit approval.

Prereq for the `gh` path: authenticate with GitHub CLI once, then confirm with `gh auth status`. Repo and workflow scopes are typically required for Actions inspection.

## Inputs

- `repo`: path inside the repo (default `.`)
- `pr`: PR number or URL (optional; defaults to current branch PR)
- GitHub MCP connection, or `gh` authentication for the repo host

## Workflow

1. Resolve the PR.
   - If the user provides a PR number or URL, use that directly.
   - Otherwise prefer the current branch PR with `gh pr view --json number,url`.
   - When repo and PR are known, fetch PR metadata and patch context through GitHub MCP tools.
2. Inspect failing checks (GitHub Actions only).
   - Preferred when MCP Actions tools are available: list check runs / workflow runs for the PR, then fetch job logs for each failure.
   - Otherwise run the bundled script (handles gh field drift and job-log fallbacks):
     - `python scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py --repo "." --pr "<number-or-url>"`
     - Add `--json` for machine-friendly output.
   - Manual `gh` fallback:
     - `gh pr checks <pr> --json name,state,bucket,link,startedAt,completedAt,workflow`
       - If a field is rejected, rerun with the available fields reported by `gh`.
     - For each failing check, extract the run id from `detailsUrl` and run:
       - `gh run view <run_id> --json name,workflowName,conclusion,status,url,event,headBranch,headSha`
       - `gh run view <run_id> --log`
     - If the run log says it is still in progress, fetch job logs directly:
       - `gh api "/repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/jobs/<job_id>/logs" > "<path>"`
3. Scope non-GitHub Actions checks.
   - If `detailsUrl` is not a GitHub Actions run, label it as external and only report the URL.
   - Do not attempt Buildkite or other providers; keep the workflow lean.
4. Summarize failures for the user.
   - Provide the failing check name, run URL (if any), and a concise log snippet.
   - Call out missing logs explicitly and do not over-claim certainty.
5. Propose a focused fix plan and wait for approval.
   - Keep the plan tied directly to the failing checks and the observed root cause.
6. Implement after approval.
   - Apply the approved fix locally.
   - Run the most relevant local verification available.
7. Recheck status and summarize residual risk.
   - Suggest re-running the relevant tests and `gh pr checks`.
   - Report what is still unverified, what may still be flaky, and whether any failing checks were external and therefore not actionable here.

## Guardrails

- Do not imply that MCP can replace `gh` for Actions log retrieval unless those tools are connected.
- Treat non-GitHub Actions providers as report-only unless the user explicitly wants a separate investigation path.
- If the failure is clearly unrelated to the local diff, say so before proposing code changes.
